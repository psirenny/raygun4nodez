raygun4nodez
============

A browserifiable version of the [https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4node](raygun4nodez) plugin.
In the browser it depends on the [https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4js](raygun4js) plugin.

Motivation
----------

The raygun4node plugin does not work in the browser and is missing many of the
features found in it's browser counterpart: raygun4js. This plugin tries to
normalize those features and work in both environments.

Installation
------------

    $ npm install raygun4nodez --save
