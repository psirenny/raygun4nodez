raygun4nodez
============

A browserifiable version of the [https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4node](raygun4node) plugin.

Deprecated
----------

This module is deprecated. Please use (lasergun)[https://github.com/psirenny/lasergun] instead.

Motivation
----------

The raygun4node plugin does not work in the browser and is missing many of the
features found in it's browser counterpart: raygun4js.

This plugin tries to
normalize those features and work in both environments.

Dependencies
------------

Requires [https://github.com/MindscapeHQ/raygun4js](raygun4js) in the browser.

Installation
------------

    $ npm install raygun4nodez --save

    $ bower install raygun4js --save
    # include the raygun4js script
